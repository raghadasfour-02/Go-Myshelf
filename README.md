# Raghad's Shelf
A place to preserve the collection of books I own, my reviews, and accept recommendations from people.

---
### Inspiration
I have many books. Like far too many. This will be a place for me to keep a record of the books I own, my review on them, and enable others to recommend new books to me.
### What did I learn? [ABOUT PROGRAMMING]
This was my first project in Go. 
- Golang variables and functions
- Golang packages and modules
- Interfaces, and error handling 
### What did I learn? [ABOUT WRITING SOFTWARE]
- When compared to Python/C++/Java that support exceptions with try-catch-like syntax, Golang doesnâ€™t offer traditional exceptions and try-catch blocks as a language feature. Instead, it allows me to return the error as the second return value of functions. This approach allows for the handling of the error within the same flow of the program without creating another logical flow. 
- Since Golang does not support traditional classes and inheritance, I have started to think about procedural and functional paradigms before drawing class diagrams for my next software project
